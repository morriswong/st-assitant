   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env.local` file with your Azure OpenAI credentials:
   ```
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_here
   AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o
   AZURE_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id  # Optional, will create new assistant if not provided
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`
